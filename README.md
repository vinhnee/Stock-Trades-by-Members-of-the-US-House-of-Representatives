# Stock Trades by Members of the US House of Representatives
In this project, we are attempting to predict whether a particular trade is a buy or sell, making this a classification problem. The target variable we will try and predict is 'type', which has three possibilities: purchase, sale_full, and sale_partial. We will be combining sale_full and sale_partial into one 'sale' value to make the column a binary type. We are hoping to get an R^2 score of .75 or higher on our model performances as that would let us know that our model works well.
Attached is the Jupyter Notebook showing model training, results, and discussion.
